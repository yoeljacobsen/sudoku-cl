## Checkpoint

This checkpoint reflects the state of the project after implementing the Sudoku solver with unit tests, function-level comments, optimization declarations, and a `Makefile` for building and testing. The `Makefile` now uses `ros run` and `sbcl` to create the executable.

## Future Sessions

In future sessions, I will be able to:

*   **Rebuild `problems.json`**: Fetch new Sudoku problem sets from specified online repositories and update the `problems.json` file using `make rebuild`.
*   **Automate Updates**: Automatically commit changes to `problems.json`, `GEMINI.md`, and the checkpoint file after rebuilding the problem set.
