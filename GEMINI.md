## Checkpoint

This checkpoint reflects the state of the project after implementing the Sudoku solver with unit tests, function-level comments, optimization declarations, and a `Makefile` for building and testing. The `Makefile` now uses `ros run` and `sbcl` to create the executable.

## Debugging Session

During a debugging session, we identified and fixed several issues:

*   **Environment Variable Parsing**: The program crashed when the `NUM_PROBLEMS` environment variable was not set. This was fixed by handling the case where the variable is an empty string.
*   **JSON Parsing**: The program failed to parse the `problems.json` file correctly because it was reading only the first line. This was fixed by reading the entire file.
*   **JSON Key Mismatch**: The program failed to extract data from the parsed JSON because of a mismatch in the case of the keys. This was fixed by using the correct keys.

## Future Sessions

In future sessions, I will be able to:

*   **Rebuild `problems.json`**: Fetch new Sudoku problem sets from specified online repositories and update the `problems.json` file using `make rebuild`.
*   **Automate Updates**: Automatically commit changes to `problems.json`, `GEMINI.md`, and the checkpoint file after rebuilding the problem set.
