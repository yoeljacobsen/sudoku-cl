This checkpoint reflects the state of the project after:

*   Implementing a Sudoku solver in Common Lisp.
*   Adding unit tests using `fiveam`.
*   Including function-level comments and optimization declarations.
*   Replacing `run.sh` with a `Makefile` for `run`, `test`, and `build` targets.
*   Attempting to integrate a `make rebuild` target for fetching new problems (currently facing issues with `ros build` and file parsing).
